  summary: 'A neuron is just logistic regression. The magic starts when you stack them: hidden layers learn their own features, nonlinear activations make stacking meaningful, and suddenly problems no straight line could solve (XOR!) become easy. This lesson builds the multi-layer perceptron from parts you already own.',

      title: 'Usopp\'s one-line lookout rule meets the Grand Line',
      text: 'In East Blue, Usopp runs the crow\'s nest with a single scoring rule: 3×(cannon count) + 2×(black flag) + 1×(approach speed), and if the total clears his threshold, he fires the alarm. One weighted sum, one threshold — Usopp is a perceptron, and in East Blue it works, because dangerous ships there simply look dangerous. Then the crew enters the Grand Line and the rule dies in a week. A Marine warship bristles with cannons and flies government colors — armed AND official, dangerous to pirates. A "merchant" ship with no visible weapons and a friendly flag turns out to be bounty hunters in disguise — unarmed-looking AND friendly, also dangerous. But an armed ship flying an ally pirate flag (Law\'s submarine) is safe, and a genuinely unarmed merchant is safe. Danger is now "armed XOR friendly-looking" — the threats sit on both diagonal corners, and NO single weighted sum of Usopp\'s signals can separate them; raise the threshold and he misses the disguised hunters, lower it and he alarms on Law. The fix is not a better threshold — it is a committee. Zoro watches for one pattern: "armed and flying hostile colors" (the warship feature). Sanji watches for the opposite: "harmless-looking but wrong — too many crew below deck, riding too low in the water" (the wolf-in-sheep\'s-clothing feature). Each of them is still just a simple threshold — a straight line. But Luffy on the deck combines their two shouts with a trivial rule: if EITHER lookout fires, sound the alarm. Two simple detectors plus one combiner solves what no single detector could: Zoro and Sanji are a hidden layer, their learned patterns are hidden features, and Luffy is the output neuron. And notice nobody told Zoro exactly what to look for — after enough ambushes (training data), he tuned his own instincts (weights).'

Yet the system demonstrably works: numbers go in Monday (input layer), reports come out Friday (output layer), the company profits. What happens in between — "statistical analysis and data reconfiguration" — is real, useful, and un-nameable by outsiders. That is precisely a hidden layer: when you train an MLP, the intermediate neurons learn features that make the output easy, but nobody assigned them names, and if you inspect neuron 7 of layer 2 you\'ll usually find something Rachel-level un-nameable. Interpretability research is the whole subfield trying to figure out what Chandler actually does. The lesson: judge hidden layers by whether the output works, not by whether you can label each unit.'

      q: 'Why is a layer literally a matrix multiplication, and why do GPUs matter?',
      a: 'A layer of n neurons on m inputs holds an n×m weight matrix W and a bias vector b (n×1). Computing all n neurons at once is h = act(Wx + b) — one matrix-vector product. A batch of k examples stacks the x\'s into a matrix, making it a matrix-matrix product. So a forward pass is nothing but chained matrix multiplies with elementwise squashes — and matrix multiply is embarrassingly parallel: every output cell is an independent dot product. GPUs have thousands of small cores built for exactly this, which is why a GPU trains in hours what a CPU takes weeks to do, and why the entire deep-learning era tracks GPU progress. When PyTorch code says nn.Linear(784, 128), it means: allocate a 128×784 W and a 128-vector b, and on every call do Wx + b.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What exactly does "the network learns features" mean mechanically?',
      a: 'Each hidden neuron\'s weight vector defines a direction in input space (Part 1: a dot product measures alignment). The neuron fires strongly for inputs aligned with its weights — so the weight vector IS a template of the pattern the neuron detects. During training, gradient descent nudges these templates toward whatever patterns reduce the loss: in vision nets, first-layer templates famously converge to edge and color-blob detectors (you can plot the weights as tiny images and see the edges). "Learning features" = gradient descent sculpting weight-vector templates so that later layers get a representation in which the task is linearly easy. Nobody chooses the features; the loss does.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Why does softmax exponentiate instead of just normalizing the scores?',
      a: 'Three reasons. (1) Scores (logits) can be negative; e^z makes everything positive so we can normalize into probabilities. (2) exp amplifies differences — a logit gap of 3 becomes a probability ratio of e³ ≈ 20 — giving a sharp but differentiable "argmax-like" behavior (hence SOFTmax). (3) The killer reason: softmax + cross-entropy have a jointly beautiful gradient — ∂L/∂zᵢ = pᵢ − yᵢ, prediction minus truth, the same clean form you saw for logistic regression (sigmoid is just 2-class softmax). Plain normalization (z/Σz) has none of these properties and breaks on negatives. Bonus fact for the lab and interviews: softmax(z) = softmax(z − c) for any constant c, so implementations subtract max(z) first to stop e^z overflowing — "the log-sum-exp trick".'

    {
      q: 'What does the bias term actually do — could we drop it?',
      a: 'Without b, the decision boundary w·x = 0 must pass through the origin, and a ReLU neuron must fire on exactly half of all directions. The bias shifts the threshold: ReLU(w·x + b) lets the neuron stay silent until the pattern strength clears −b. Usopp\'s alarm threshold IS his bias. Drop biases and you lose the ability to place boundaries freely — networks still sort of work (and some transformer variants do drop them, compensating with normalization layers), but for the MLPs here, the bias is one extra number per neuron that buys full freedom of boundary placement. In code it\'s the "+ b" in Wx + b and the bias=True default in nn.Linear.'

    {
      q: 'What happens if you initialize all weights of a neural network to zero?',
      a: 'Every neuron in a layer receives identical inputs, has identical weights, so produces identical outputs and — crucially — identical gradients. They update in lockstep forever: the layer behaves as one neuron duplicated n times, and no feature diversity can ever emerge. This is the symmetry-breaking problem. Random initialization breaks the tie so different neurons can specialize into different features. (Biases CAN start at zero — the random weights already break symmetry.) Follow-up worth volunteering: initialization scale also matters — too large saturates activations, too small shrinks signals layer by layer; schemes like Xavier/He initialization pick the variance to keep activation magnitudes stable across depth.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Why do neural networks need nonlinear activation functions?',
      a: 'Because a composition of linear maps is itself linear: stacking Linear layers without activations collapses algebraically into a single matrix, so a 100-layer "network" could still only learn linear decision boundaries — it couldn\'t even solve XOR. The nonlinearity between layers prevents the collapse and lets each layer genuinely re-represent its input, folding the space so that classes which were not linearly separable become separable. Concretely: with ReLU hidden units, two neurons plus a linear combiner compute XOR — a = ReLU(x₁+x₂), b = ReLU(x₁+x₂−1), y = a−2b. The choice of nonlinearity then matters for optimization: sigmoids saturate and vanish gradients in deep stacks; ReLU keeps gradient 1 on active paths, which is why it became the default.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Explain sigmoid vs tanh vs ReLU, and when you\'d use each.',
      a: 'Sigmoid maps to (0,1) — use it exactly where you need a probability: the output of a binary classifier. As a hidden activation it is poor: it saturates on both ends and its derivative peaks at 0.25, so deep stacks suffer vanishing gradients. Tanh maps to (−1,1); being zero-centered it optimizes better than sigmoid and it survives in some RNN gates, but it still saturates. ReLU = max(0,z): gradient exactly 1 when active, trivially cheap, sparse activations — the modern default for hidden layers in MLPs and CNNs. Its failure mode is dead units (always-negative input ⇒ zero gradient forever), mitigated by LeakyReLU or by GELU — the smooth ReLU relative that transformers (BERT, GPT) use. Practical answer: ReLU/GELU hidden, sigmoid for binary output, softmax for multiclass output, and tanh mostly when a recipe (e.g., LSTM) calls for it.'

      q: 'Design the output layer and loss for: (a) predicting house price, (b) spam detection, (c) classifying a news article into 20 topics, (d) tagging an article with any subset of 20 topics.',
      a: '(a) Regression: 1 linear neuron, no activation, MSE loss (or MAE/Huber if outliers are a concern — MSE is MLE under Gaussian noise, from Part 1). (b) Binary: 1 neuron + sigmoid, binary cross-entropy. (c) Multi-class, exactly one label: 20 neurons + softmax, categorical cross-entropy — softmax couples the outputs so probabilities compete and sum to 1. (d) Multi-LABEL, labels independent: 20 neurons each with its own sigmoid + binary cross-entropy per output — no softmax, because softmax forces the topics to compete while an article can be about several. The (c)-vs-(d) distinction — softmax for mutually exclusive classes, independent sigmoids for multi-label — is precisely what interviewers are probing with this question.'
