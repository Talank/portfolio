"""How the ACLS bedtime voyage is pronounced.

The other voyages on this site are Nepali prose with English terms dropped into
it, and shared/ne_pronounce.py exists to respell those terms in Devanagari so a
Nepali voice can say them. This course has no Nepali in it at all.

That is the whole point of the course. An ECG is read in a vocabulary that has
no Nepali — there is no other word for a QRS complex, and a listener who learns
"तल्लो लहर" instead of "S wave" has learned something they cannot use in a
resuscitation room, on a certification exam, or in a handover. So the terms stay
in English, and every voice on the ward is an American one that knows how to say
them.

What is left for this file is small and specific:

  * **Acronyms.** An English engine reads "QRS" as a word ("qurs"), "aVR" as
    "avr", and "PEA" as "pea", the vegetable. Spacing the letters out is the
    only lever available — edge-tts escapes SSML, so <say-as> is not an option
    (see build_bedtime.to_speakable).

  * **The handful of terms that are not read the way they are spelled.**
    STEMI is "stemmy", ROSC is "rosk", Mobitz is not "mo-bits", and torsades de
    pointes is French.

  * **Numbers with units.** Nothing here: the scripts write "one hundred and
    twenty milliseconds", not "120 ms", because a unit abbreviation is a
    pronunciation problem the prose can simply decline to have.

Everything in the table is checked by check_bedtime.py against what the scripts
actually contain, so an entry that stops being used shows up rather than sitting
here forever.
